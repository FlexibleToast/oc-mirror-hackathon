# [v2] oc-mirror v2 documentation lacks operational guidance for differential archive behavior

**Type:** RFE (Request for Enhancement)  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** oc-mirror  
**Labels:** v2, documentation, operational, customer-guidance  

## Description

**Description of problem:**

oc-mirror v2 documentation does not adequately explain the differential nature of archives generated by subsequent runs, leading to customer confusion and failed air-gapped operations. The documentation implies that each archive set is complete and self-contained, when in reality they contain only changes since the previous run.

**Version-Release number of selected component:**
- oc-mirror v2 documentation (current as of August 2025)
- oc-mirror v2 (4.19.0-202507292137.p0.gaa8c685.assembly.stream.el9-aa8c685)

**How reproducible:**
Always - affects all customers attempting operational air-gapped updates

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Follow current oc-mirror v2 documentation for air-gapped operations
2. Perform initial mirror operation (creates baseline archives)
3. Update configuration (add operators, new versions, etc.)
4. Perform subsequent mirror operation (creates smaller differential archives)
5. Attempt to transfer only the new archives to air-gapped environment
6. Attempt mirror-to-mirror operation â†’ FAILS

**Actual results:**

Current documentation issues:
- No explanation of differential vs complete archive behavior
- No guidance on cumulative content requirements
- No operational patterns for ongoing updates
- No best practices for air-gapped environments with multiple updates
- No troubleshooting for "manifest unknown" errors related to missing content
- Archive size reduction is not explained in operational context

**Expected results:**

Documentation should include:

1. **Clear Explanation of Behavior:**
   - "oc-mirror v2 generates differential archives on subsequent runs"
   - "Archives contain only changes since the last mirror operation"
   - "Complete operations require access to all previous content"

2. **Operational Patterns Section:**
   - Cumulative archive management strategies
   - Air-gapped transfer best practices
   - Storage planning for growing archive sets
   - Versioning and rollback strategies

3. **Customer Scenarios:**
   - Monthly update workflows
   - Major version upgrade procedures  
   - Disaster recovery considerations
   - Multi-environment synchronization

4. **Troubleshooting Section:**
   - Common errors when missing cumulative content
   - Archive validation procedures
   - Content verification methods

5. **Architecture Diagrams:**
   - Differential archive relationships
   - Cache and archive dependencies
   - Air-gapped transfer workflows

**Additional info:**

This documentation gap has significant customer impact:
- Failed air-gapped deployments
- Increased support cases
- Customer confusion about operational procedures
- Incorrect bandwidth and storage planning
- Lost confidence in disconnected installation capabilities

**Suggested Documentation Additions:**

1. **New Section:** "Understanding Differential Archives"
2. **New Section:** "Air-Gapped Operational Patterns" 
3. **Enhanced:** Troubleshooting guide with differential-specific scenarios
4. **Enhanced:** Architecture documentation with dependency explanations
5. **New:** Customer workflow examples for common scenarios

**Customer Impact:** High - All air-gapped customers using oc-mirror v2 for operational updates

**Business Impact:** Customer satisfaction, support load reduction, successful air-gapped deployments
