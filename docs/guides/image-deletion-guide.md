## Overview

This guide walks you through safely removing old OpenShift images (**4.19.2 ‚Üí 4.19.6**) from your mirror registry after upgrading your cluster to **4.19.7**, using our standardized `oc-mirror` deletion workflow.

### What You'll Accomplish
- üîç **Pre-deletion validation** of current registry and cluster state
- üìã **Generate deletion plan** using our standardized script (safe preview)
- üëÄ **Review generated plan** to verify what will be deleted
- üóëÔ∏è **Execute controlled deletion** of old OpenShift versions
- ‚úÖ **Post-deletion verification** of registry and cluster health

### Safety First
- ‚úÖ **Two-phase process**: Generate plan ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Execute
- ‚úÖ **No accidental deletions**: Must explicitly review and approve
- ‚úÖ **Preserves current versions**: Only removes specified old versions
- ‚úÖ **Rollback ready**: Generated plans serve as audit trail
- ‚ùó **Workspace Critical**: Must use original mirror workspace (`content/`) - contains essential Cincinnati graph data

## Prerequisites

### Required Access
- Administrative access to the mirror registry (`$(hostname):8443`)
- Push/delete permissions on the target registry
- Valid authentication for registry operations
- Access to our standardized deletion scripts

### Required Tools
- `oc-mirror` v2 (4.19.0 or later)
- `oc` CLI tool (for verification)
- Valid `auth.json` with registry credentials
- Our deletion scripts: `oc-mirror-delete-generate.sh`

### Technical Requirements
- Registry must contain the target images for deletion
- **CRITICAL**: Must use original mirror workspace (`content/`) - contains essential Cincinnati graph data
- Network connectivity to mirror registry
- **Important**: Consistent cache directory usage (same host recommended)

### Cluster State Requirements
- Cluster should be **upgraded past** the versions you plan to delete
- No running clusters should depend on the versions being deleted
- Verify upgrade history to avoid deleting required intermediate versions

## Pre-Deletion Planning

### 1. Verify Current Cluster Version

First, confirm your cluster is running a version **newer** than what you plan to delete:

```bash
# Check current cluster version
oc get clusterversion

# Expected output: 4.19.7 (or later)
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.19.7    True        False         24h     Cluster version is 4.19.7
```

### 2. Inventory Registry Content

Verify the versions you plan to delete actually exist in your registry:

```bash
# Check versions you plan to delete (adjust versions as needed)
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.2-x86_64 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ 4.19.2 present" || echo "‚ùå 4.19.2 not found"
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.3-x86_64 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ 4.19.3 present" || echo "‚ùå 4.19.3 not found"
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.6-x86_64 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ 4.19.6 present" || echo "‚ùå 4.19.6 not found"

# Use this command template to check any version:
# oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:VERSION-x86_64
```

**üí° Tip:** Only verify the versions you plan to delete. No need to check your current cluster version - if your cluster is running, those images are obviously accessible. You can also use your web browser to review the inventory.


### 3. Review Deletion Configuration

Verify your deletion configuration targets the correct versions:

```bash
# Review the deletion configuration
cat oc-mirror-master/imageset-delete.yaml
```

Expected configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: DeleteImageSetConfiguration
delete:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.19
      minVersion: 4.19.2
      maxVersion: 4.19.6  # Only delete versions older than current 4.19.7
    graph: true
```

## Step 1: Generate Deletion Plan

### 1.1 Navigate to Working Directory

```bash
# Navigate to the oc-mirror working directory
cd oc-mirror-master/
```

### 1.2 Execute Deletion Plan Generation

Run our standardized deletion plan generation script:

```bash
# Generate deletion plan (SAFE - no actual deletions occur)
./oc-mirror-delete-generate.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üóëÔ∏è Generating deletion plan for old images...
üéØ Target registry: bastion.sandbox762.opentlc.com:8443
üìã Config: imageset-delete.yaml
üìÅ Workspace: file://content (original mirror workspace)
‚ö†Ô∏è  SAFE MODE: No deletions will be executed

[INFO] üëã Hello, welcome to oc-mirror
[INFO] ‚öôÔ∏è  setting up the environment for you...
[INFO] üîÄ workflow mode: diskToMirror / delete
[INFO] üïµ  going to discover the necessary images...
[INFO] üìÑ Generating delete file...
[INFO] content/working-dir/delete file created
[INFO] üëã Goodbye, thank you for using oc-mirror

‚úÖ Deletion plan generated successfully!
üìÑ Plan saved to: content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml
üîç IMPORTANT: Review the deletion plan before executing!
```

### 1.3 Verify Generation Success

Check that the deletion plan was created in your original workspace:

```bash
# Verify deletion plan was generated
ls -la content/working-dir/delete/
```

You should see:
```
content/working-dir/delete/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delete-images.yaml        # Main deletion plan (200KB+ file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ delete-imageset-config.yaml  # Configuration used
```

## Step 2: Review Deletion Plan

### 2.1 Examine Generated Deletion Plan

**CRITICAL SAFETY STEP:** Review the generated deletion plan before executing:

```bash
# Review the deletion plan
cat content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml
```

### 2.2 Understand the Deletion Plan Format

The generated plan will contain:
- **Manifests to delete**: Specific image manifests with SHA256 digests
- **Registry locations**: Exact paths in your registry
- **Release versions**: Confirm it targets 4.19.2-4.19.6 only

### 2.3 Verify Target Versions

Look for entries like:
```yaml
# Expected entries in deletion plan
- image: bastion.sandbox762.opentlc.com:8443/openshift/release-images@sha256:...
  # Should target versions 4.19.2, 4.19.3, 4.19.4, 4.19.5, 4.19.6
```

### 2.4 Confirm Preservation of Current Version

**Verify that 4.19.7 (your current cluster version) is NOT listed for deletion:**

```bash
# This should return NO results (4.19.7 should be preserved)
grep -i "4.19.7\|4.19.8\|4.19.9\|4.19.10" content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml || echo "‚úÖ Current versions are preserved"
```

### 2.5 Estimate Deletion Impact

Count the number of images to be deleted:

```bash
# Count images in deletion plan
grep -c "image:" content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml
echo "images will be deleted from the registry"
```

## Step 3: Execute Deletion

### 3.1 Final Pre-Execution Checklist

Before executing the deletion, confirm:

- [ ] **Reviewed deletion plan thoroughly**
- [ ] **Verified current cluster version (4.19.7+)**
- [ ] **Confirmed no running clusters need deleted versions**
- [ ] **Registry backup available (if required by policy)**
- [ ] **Coordinated with relevant teams**

### 3.2 Execute Deletion

After thorough review, execute the deletion using the generated plan:

```bash
# Execute deletion using the generated and reviewed plan
oc mirror delete \
    --delete-yaml-file content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml \
    docker://$(hostname):8443 \
    --v2 \
    --cache-dir .cache
```

### 3.3 Monitor Deletion Progress

**Expected Output:**
```
[INFO] Starting deletion process...
[INFO] Removing manifests from registry...
[INFO] Cleaning registry storage...
[INFO] Updating cache...

‚úÖ Deletion completed successfully!
```

### 3.4 Verify Deletion Completion

The deletion process should complete without errors. Look for:
- ‚úÖ No error messages about missing permissions
- ‚úÖ Confirmation that manifests were removed
- ‚úÖ Cache cleanup completed

## Step 4: Post-Deletion Verification

### 4.1 Verify Deleted Versions Are Gone

Test that the deleted versions are no longer accessible:

```bash
# These should now fail (versions deleted)
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.2-x86_64 2>&1 | grep -q "not found" && echo "‚úÖ 4.19.2 successfully deleted" || echo "‚ùå 4.19.2 still present"
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.6-x86_64 2>&1 | grep -q "not found" && echo "‚úÖ 4.19.6 successfully deleted" || echo "‚ùå 4.19.6 still present"
```

### 4.2 Verify Current Version Is Preserved

Test that your current cluster version is still available:

```bash
# This should still work (current version preserved)
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.7-x86_64
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Name:      4.19.7
Digest:    sha256:...
Created:   ...
OS/Arch:   linux/amd64
Manifests: ...
```

### 4.3 Verify Cluster Health

Ensure your running cluster is unaffected:

```bash
# Check cluster operators
oc get co

# All operators should show AVAILABLE=True, PROGRESSING=False, DEGRADED=False
```

### 4.4 Test Registry Functionality

Verify the registry is still functioning properly:

```bash
# Test registry connectivity
curl -k https://$(hostname):8443/v2/

# Should return: {}%
```

### 4.5 Check Storage Reclamation

Optionally check storage space reclaimed:

```bash
# Check available space (should show reclaimed storage)
df -h /opt/quay/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. NoGraphData Error During Plan Generation
**Error:** `NoGraphData: No graph data found on disk`

**Root Cause:** Delete operations require Cincinnati graph data from the original mirror workspace to understand OpenShift version relationships.

**Solution:**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always use the original mirror workspace
# ‚ùå WRONG - separate workspace lacks graph data
oc mirror delete --workspace file://delete-workspace ...

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - use original workspace with metadata
oc mirror delete --workspace file://content ...
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Delete operations need Cincinnati graph data to understand version relationships
- Graph data is stored in `content/working-dir/` from original mirroring
- Separate workspaces lack this essential metadata
- Our standardized script uses the correct workspace automatically

#### 2. Permission Denied During Deletion
**Error:** `403 Forbidden` or permission denied errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify registry authentication
podman login $(hostname):8443

# Check auth file
cat ~/.config/containers/auth.json

# Ensure your account has delete permissions
```

#### 3. Cache Directory Issues
**Error:** Cache-related errors during deletion

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use consistent cache directory
oc mirror delete --cache-dir .cache --delete-yaml-file content/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml docker://$(hostname):8443 --v2

# If cache is corrupted, remove and recreate
rm -rf .cache/
```

#### 4. Registry Connectivity Problems
**Error:** Cannot connect to registry

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test registry connectivity
curl -k https://$(hostname):8443/v2/

# Check firewall/network settings
# Verify registry service is running
```

#### 5. Generated Plan Is Empty
**Error:** No images found for deletion

**Possible Causes:**
- Target versions don't exist in registry
- Configuration file has incorrect version ranges
- Registry path issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify images exist before deletion
oc adm release info $(hostname):8443/openshift/release-images:4.19.2-x86_64

# Check configuration file
cat imageset-delete.yaml
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check oc-mirror version
oc-mirror --v2 version

# List deletion plan contents
find content/working-dir/delete/ -name "*.yaml" -exec ls -la {} \;

# Verify registry content
podman search $(hostname):8443/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Test registry authentication
podman login --get-login $(hostname):8443

# Check workspace has graph data (critical for delete operations)
ls -la content/working-dir/hold-release/
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### If Deletion Goes Wrong

1. **Stop immediately** if errors occur
2. **Check cluster health**: `oc get co`
3. **Verify current version availability**: `oc adm release info`
4. **Re-mirror if needed**: Use your mirroring scripts to restore content

#### Emergency Recovery

If critical versions were accidentally deleted:

```bash
# Re-mirror required content immediately
cd oc-mirror-master/
./oc-mirror-to-disk.sh      # Mirror to disk
./oc-mirror-from-disk-to-registry.sh  # Upload to registry
```
